# This is the making of my probably first ever good text-based adventure game, T.A.R.D.I.S.py

## Initial idea:

*So, why did I decide to make an entier text-based game off of the spaceship named "TARDIS"? Well, it's quite funny actually. I had just finished doing my business on the toilet, when I came outside and hopped onto my bed. I remembered hearing about some person making the tardis in Minecraft. I thought to myself: 'Man, I'm bored, and I want to do some programming... Hang on a minute!*
*And the rest was history...*
