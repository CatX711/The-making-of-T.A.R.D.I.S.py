I thought to myself: 'Man, I'm bored, and I want to do some programming... Hang on a minute!*
*And the rest was history...*

# The Code:

## First Lines:

*When anyone decides to make a game, they all have to start with their first lines of code. Me, being a very unexperienced Python programmer, had very primitive lines of code.
